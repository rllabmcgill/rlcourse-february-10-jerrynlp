Double Q-learning


Q-learning sometimes has pool results under stochastic environments. Hasselt[2011] proposed Double Q-learning to overcome this problem.I implement and evaluate Sarsa, Q-learning and Double Q-learning in a standard and new randomized CliffWalking which gaussian distribution is applied to the rewards.
